## Copilot Usage Tips for Week 1

**DO:**
- Read suggestions before accepting
- Ask Copilot to explain code
- Use for learning patterns
- Generate test data quickly

**DON'T:**
- Blindly accept without understanding
- Copy without reading
- Depend on it completely
- Skip manual practice

---

## If You Get Stuck

1. Try for 10 minutes yourself
2. Ask GitHub Copilot
3. Google the specific error
4. Ask in r/learnpython
5. Message Claude with specific question

**Never stuck > 30 minutes on one problem**

## Week 1 Reflection (Sunday Night)

After completing Week 1, answer:
- What clicked for you?
- What's still confusing?

- Are you on pace for brutal mode?
- What to adjust for Week 2?
