#  Implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression 
# and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. 
# Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
# x is an integer
# y is +, -, *, or /
# z is an integer
# For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. 
# Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0
