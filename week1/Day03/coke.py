# Implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, 
# each time informing the user of the amount due. 
# Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, 
# output how many cents in change the user is owed. 
# Assume that the user will only input integers, 
# and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
